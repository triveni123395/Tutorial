<h2 id="Html">HTML</h2>
<img src="html.png">
<p>HTML is a very evolving markup language and has evolved with various versions updating. Long before its revised standards and specifications are carried in, each version has allowed its user to create web pages in a much easier and prettier way and make sites very efficient.

HTML 1.0 was released in 1993 with the intention of sharing information that can be readable and accessible via web browsers. But not many of the developers were involved in creating websites. So the language was also not growing.
Then comes HTML 2.0, published in 1995, which contains all the features of HTML 1.0 along with a few additional features, which remained the standard markup language for designing and creating websites until January 1997 and refined various core features of HTML.
Then comes HTML 3.0, where Dave Raggett introduced a fresh paper or draft on HTML. It included improved new features of HTML, giving more powerful characteristics for webmasters in designing web pages. But these powerful features of the new HTML slowed down the browser in applying further improvements.
Then comes HTML 4.01, which is widely used and was a successful version of HTML before HTML 5.0, which is currently released and used worldwide. HTML 5 can be said for an extended version of HTML 4.01, which was published in the year 2012.

<h2 id="Python">PYTHON</h2>
<img src="python.png">
<p>Python was developed by Guido van Rossum (a Dutch programmer) in the late 1980s and early nineties at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands.

Python is derived from many other languages, including ABC, Modula-3, C, C++, Algol-68, SmallTalk, and Unix shell and other scripting languages. Guido van Rossum wanted Python to be a high-level language that was powerful yet readable and easy to use.

Python is copyrighted. Like Perl, Python source code is now available under the GNU General Public License (GPL).

For many uninitiated people, the word Python is related to a species of snake. Rossum though attributes the choice of the name Python to a popular comedy series Monty Python's Flying Circus on BBC.

Being the principal architect of Python, the developer community conferred upon him the title of Benevolent Dictator for Life (BDFL). However, in 2018, Rossum relinquished the title. Thereafter, the development and distribution of the reference implementation of Python is handled by a nonprofit organization Python Software Foundation.

<h2 id="Oracle">Oracle</h2>
<img src="oracle.png">
<p>Larry Ellison co-founded Oracle Corporation in 1977 with Bob Miner and Ed Oates under the name Software Development Laboratories (SDL). Ellison took inspiration from the 1970 paper written by Edgar F. Codd on relational database management systems (RDBMS) named "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks." He heard about the IBM System R database from an article in the IBM Research Journal provided by Oates. Ellison wanted to make Oracle's product compatible with System R, but failed to do so as IBM kept the error codes for their DBMS a secret. SDL changed its name to Relational Software, Inc (RSI) in 1979, then again to Oracle Systems Corporation in 1983, to align itself more closely with its flagship product Oracle Database. The name also drew from the 1977 CIA project codename, which was also Oracle's first customer. At this stage Bob Miner served as the company's senior programmer. On March 12, 1986, the company had its initial public offering.

In 1995, Oracle Systems Corporation changed its name to Oracle Corporation, officially named Oracle, but is sometimes referred to as Oracle Corporation, the name of the holding company. Part of Oracle Corporation's early success arose from using the C programming language to implement its products. This eased porting to different operating systems most of which support C.</p>

<p>Java programming language was originally developed by Sun Microsystems which was initiated by James Gosling and released in 1995 as core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform (Java 1.0 [J2SE]). History of even naming of the Java is very interesting. It went under many names.
    ava Name History
GreenTalk
James Gosling was leading a team named as 'Green' team. Target of this team was to create a new language which can work on multiple electronic devices seemlessly. Initially C++ was the original choice to develop the project. James Gosling wanted to enhance C++ to achieve the target but due to high memory usage, that idea was rejected and team started with a new language initially named as GreenTalk. The file extension used as .gt. Later this language was termed as Oak and finally to Java.

Oak
James Gosling renamed language to Oak. There was an Oak tree in front of his office. James Gosling used this name as Oak represents solidarity and Oak tree is the national tree of multiple countries like USA, France, Romania etc. But Oak technologies already had Oak as a trademark and James team had to brainstrom another title for the language.

Finally Java
Team put multiple names like DNA, Silk, Ruby and Java. Java was finalized by the team. James Gosling tabled Java title based on type of espresso coffee bean. Java is an island in Indonesia where new coffee was discovered termed as Java coffee. As per James Gosling, Java was among the top choice along with Silk. Finally Java was selected as it was quite unique and represented the essence of being dynamic,revolutionary and fun to say.

Sun released the first public implementation as Java 1.0 in 1995. It promised Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA), providing no-cost run-times on popular platforms.

On 13 November, 2006, Sun released much of Java as free and open source software under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL).

On 8 May, 2007, Sun finished the process, making all of Java's core code free and open-source, aside from a small portion of code to which Sun did not hold the copyright.

The latest release of the Java Standard Edition is Java SE 21. With the advancement of Java and its widespread popularity, multiple configurations were built to suit various types of platforms. For example: J2EE for Enterprise Applications, J2ME for Mobile Applications.

<h2 id="sql">SQL</h2>
<img src="sql,png.jpg">
<p>SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard programming language for managing and manipulating relational databases. It has a long and rich history, dating back to the 1970s. In this tutorial, we will look at the evolution of SQL, from its early beginnings as SEQUEL to its current role as a crucial tool in modern data management.
SQL was first developed in the early 1970s at IBM by a team led by Donald D. Chamberlin and Raymond F. Boyce. The original name of the language was SEQUEL, which stood for "Structured English Query Language." SEQUEL was designed to be a simple and intuitive way to access and manipulate data stored in IBM's System R relational database management system. SEQUEL was later renamed to SQL, and IBM released the first commercial implementation of the language in 1981 as part of their System R relational database management system (RDBMS).

SQL quickly became the standard language for interacting with relational databases, and it was soon adopted by other RDBMS vendors such as Oracle, Sybase, and Microsoft. The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the International Standards Organization (ISO) published official SQL standards in 1986 and 1987, respectively.

</ul>
<p>The term “Data Science” was created in the early 1960s to describe a new profession that would support the understanding and interpretation of the large amounts of data which was being amassed at the time. (At the time, there was no way of predicting the truly massive amounts of data over the next fifty years.) Data Science continues to evolve as a discipline using computer science and statistical methodology to make useful predictions and gain insights in a wide range of fields. While Data Science is used in areas such as astronomy and medicine, it is also used in business to help make smarter decisions.

Statistics, and the use of statistical models, are deeply rooted within the field of Data Science. Data Science started with statistics and has evolved to include concepts/practices such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and the Internet of Things, to name a few. As more and more data has become available, first by way of recorded shopping behaviors and trends, businesses have been collecting and storing it in ever greater amounts. With the growth of the Internet, the Internet of Things, and the exponential growth of data volumes available to enterprises, there has been a flood of new information or big data. Once the doors were opened by businesses seeking to increase profits and drive better decision-making, the use of big data started being applied to other fields, such as medicine, engineering, and social sciences.</p>
